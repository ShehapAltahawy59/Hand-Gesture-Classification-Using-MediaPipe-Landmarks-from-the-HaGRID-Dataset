    D --> E[Flask Web Interface]
```

## Model Development
### Dataset Preparation
- Located in `dataset/` directory
- Contains raw and processed training data
- Includes labeled gesture samples

### Preprocessing Pipeline (notebooks/)
1. Data normalization
2. Feature engineering
3. Dimensionality reduction
4. Train-test splitting

### Model Training Workflow
1. Initial evaluation of multiple algorithms
2. Selection of top 3 performers (SVM, KNN, Random Forest)
3. Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
4. Final model selection based on:
   - Accuracy (98.7% for SVM)
   - Inference speed
   - Memory footprint

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam-enabled system
- 4GB RAM minimum

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Interface
```bash
python app.py
```
Access the interface at `http://localhost:5000`

### Training New Models
1. Edit preprocessing steps in `notebooks/data_processing.ipynb`
2. Run model training in `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`
3. Export best model to `models/` directory
